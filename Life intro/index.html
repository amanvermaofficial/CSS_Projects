            <h2>Intelligent Science Proffesor</h2>
            <p><b>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955)</b> was a German-born theoretical physicist.[5] Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][6] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[7] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.[11] Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.[12]</p>

            <ul>
                <li>He emphasized the concept of mass and energy being equivalent, which led to the famous formula of E = mc².</li>
                <li>Einstein was one of the first few people who dismissed the ideologies of Older Physics. He talked about how the absolute of Time was now replaced by a greater absolute of light.</li>
                <li>
                    In 1932, Einstein and de Sitter proposed the concepts that helped in the initial stages of the research of 'dark matter.'
